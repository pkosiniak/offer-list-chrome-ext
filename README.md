## THIS WILL CHANGE IN FUTURE

Project created for personal use - helps me organize, and easier collect information from job offers.

#### **The project will most likely not be supported after I find a job**
_hopefully soon 😜_

### Changelog 0.0.5:
- Some unit tests ✔
- Offer status column ✔
- Sort by column ✔
- Filtering ✔
- Keyboard shortcuts ✔
- Adjusted row height ✔
- Background color changes on hover ✔
- Partial code refactor ✔

### RoadMap:
- Unit tests*
- Adjust width of columns -- _feature_
- Change history -- _feature_
- More keyboard shortcuts -- _feature_
- Styling adjustments (stil needs some tweaks) -- _UX bug_
- Easy-filling - automatically fill cell with text selection -- _feature_
- Add support for more apps (currently only justjoin.it and nofluffjobs.com) -- _feature_
- Code refactor -- _blocked by vscode refactor extension project_
- Other features that will come in development/testing/using process

<i style="font-size: 10px;">*Next project will be in TDD... I promise!</i>

## Announcements

- **_Recently updated from React ~~16~~ to 17 and Webpack ~~4~~ to 5!_**
- **_Recently added [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) Support!_**

## Features

This is a basic Chrome Extensions boilerplate to help you write modular and modern Javascript code, load CSS easily and [automatic reload the browser on code changes](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html#automatic-refresh).

This boilerplate is updated with:

- [React 17](https://reactjs.org)
- [Webpack 5](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)
- [eslint-config-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-react-app)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

This boilerplate is heavily inspired by and adapted from [https://github.com/samuelsimoes/chrome-extension-webpack-boilerplate](https://github.com/samuelsimoes/chrome-extension-webpack-boilerplate), with additional support for React 17 features and Webpack 5.

Please open up an issue to nudge me to keep the npm packages up-to-date. FYI, it takes time to make different packages with different versions work together nicely.

## Installing and Running

### Procedures:

1. Check if your [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version is >= **14**.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Change the package's `name`, `description`, and `repository` fields in `package.json`.
4. Change the name of your extension on `src/manifest.json`.
5. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
6. Run `npm start`
7. Load your extension on Chrome following:
   1. Access `chrome://extensions/`
   2. Check `Developer mode`
   3. Click on `Load unpacked extension`
   4. Select the `build` folder.
8. Happy hacking.

## Structure

All your extension's code must be placed in the `src` folder.

The boilerplate is already prepared to have a popup, an options page, a background page, and a new tab page (which replaces the new tab page of your browser). But feel free to customize these.

## TypeScript

This boilerplate now supports TypeScript! The `Options` Page is implemented using TypeScript. Please refer to `src/pages/Options/` for example usages.

## Webpack auto-reload and HRM

To make your workflow much more efficient this boilerplate uses the [webpack server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html) to development (started with `npm start`) with auto reload feature that reloads the browser automatically every time that you save some file in your editor.

You can run the dev mode on other port if you want. Just specify the env var `port` like this:

```
$ PORT=6002 npm run start
```

## Content Scripts

Although this boilerplate uses the webpack dev server, it's also prepared to write all your bundles files on the disk at every code change, so you can point, on your extension manifest, to your bundles that you want to use as [content scripts](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts), but you need to exclude these entry points from hot reloading [(why?)](https://github.com/samuelsimoes/chrome-extension-webpack-boilerplate/issues/4#issuecomment-261788690). To do so you need to expose which entry points are content scripts on the `webpack.config.js` using the `chromeExtensionBoilerplate -> notHotReload` config. Look the example below.

Let's say that you want use the `myContentScript` entry point as content script, so on your `webpack.config.js` you will configure the entry point and exclude it from hot reloading, like this:

```js
{
  …
  entry: {
    myContentScript: "./src/js/myContentScript.js"
  },
  chromeExtensionBoilerplate: {
    notHotReload: ["myContentScript"]
  }
  …
}
```

and on your `src/manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["https://www.google.com/*"],
      "js": ["myContentScript.bundle.js"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Intelligent Code Completion

Thanks to [@hudidit](https://github.com/lxieyang/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react/issues/4)'s kind suggestions, this boilerplate supports chrome-specific intelligent code completion using [@types/chrome](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/chrome). For example:

![intellisense](https://lxieyang.github.io/static/chrome-extension-boilerplate-dev-intellisense-ed9e7c485d3eaf66417e5da4748e2c97.png)

## Packing

After the development of your extension run the command

```
$ NODE_ENV=production npm run build
```

Now, the content of `build` folder will be the extension ready to be submitted to the Chrome Web Store. Just take a look at the [official guide](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish) to more infos about publishing.

## Secrets

If you are developing an extension that talks with some API you probably are using different keys for testing and production. Is a good practice you not commit your secret keys and expose to anyone that have access to the repository.

To this task this boilerplate import the file `./secrets.<THE-NODE_ENV>.js` on your modules through the module named as `secrets`, so you can do things like this:

_./secrets.development.js_

```js
export default { key: '123' };
```

_./src/popup.js_

```js
import secrets from 'secrets';
ApiCall({ key: secrets.key });
```

:point_right: The files with name `secrets.*.js` already are ignored on the repository.
